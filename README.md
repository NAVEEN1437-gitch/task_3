This project is designed to learn and apply basic SQL operations on a mock retail dataset. The dataset simulates a small retail business with three key tables:

#### ðŸ“‚ Datasets :

- Customers_task_3 â€“ Contains customer details (ID, name, city) : [customers_task_3.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22167353/customers_task_3.csv)


- Products_task_3  â€“ Contains product catalog (ID, name, category, price) :[products_task_3.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22167357/products_task_3.csv)

- Orders_task_3  â€“ Contains order transactions (ID, customer, product, date, quantity) : [orders_task_3.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22167356/orders_task_3.csv)
