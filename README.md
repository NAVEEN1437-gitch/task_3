# SQL Retail Dataset Practice Project
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is designed to learn and apply basic SQL operations on a mock retail dataset. The dataset simulates a small retail business with three key tables:

#### ðŸ“‚ Datasets :

- Customers_task_3 â€“ Contains customer details (ID, name, city) :[Uploading cu[task_3.sql](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22167355/task_3.sql)

- Products_task_3  â€“ Contains product catalog (ID, name, category, price) :[products_task_3.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22167357/products_task_3.csv)

- Orders_task_3  â€“ Contains order transactions (ID, customer, product, date, quantity) : [orders_task_3.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22167356/orders_task_3.csv)

Using this dataset, you can practice essential SQL queries such as filtering, sorting, grouping, and joining tables to extract meaningful business insights.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Understand how to use SQL commands such as:

- SELECT â†’ Retrieve specific data

- WHERE â†’ Apply conditions and filters

- ORDER BY â†’ Sort results

- GROUP BY + aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT) â†’ Summarize data

- JOIN â†’ Combine multiple tables

- LIMIT, AS â†’ Restrict results and rename columns

- Date functions (MONTH, EXTRACT, DATEDIFF) â†’ Analyze time-based trends

## ðŸ›  Tools Required

Any SQL database engine:

- MySQL Work bench

### ðŸ“Š Sample Insights You Can Generate

- Top customers by total spending

- Most popular products and categories

- Monthly sales trends

- Customer distribution by city
